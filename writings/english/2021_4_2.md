# 4th of April of 2021 - Weekly Record

### Beginning

Hello! I'm so happy to write in this place! Though there may little one to see...

In there , I will record my life by words and pictures.

So, let's start!

### Classical music

This Monday, I got a really fantastic class which called "Music Appreciation" teached by Zhou Haihong at CCOM.

It gives me a feeling that I should like classical music and I originally did.

From Mr. Zhou's class, I know that I should not try to understand the meaning what the music is playing.

Just feeling it and get your moving from it.

This days, I always fall into a strange mood--Don't want to learn,don't want to play, just felling like a anxiety.

"Music can wash my mind, this is true."

Life is too hard, but we can get happy from classical music.

### Bad learning skill

Just this afternoon I found that I'm very poor at learning new things.

I think sometimes I looked like what Kafka had said:

Thinking twice, I know that one is me,and that is true.

I always read books at midnight but play games at class, is that irony?

But along with this problem, I also can't put my all attention to what teacher is saying.

Other words, I can't get teacher's mean, most of the time.

### Keep calm and carry on

This is what I heared in a adress by Bai Yansong.

It's about United Kingdom:

In world war tow, English almost been beat by Germany.

So head of the British sent this words to people.

### Funny pictures
