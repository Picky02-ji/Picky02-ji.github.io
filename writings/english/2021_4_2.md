### Beginning

Hello! I'm so happy to write in this place! Though there is no one to see...

In there ,I will cord my week by words and pictures.

So, let's begin!

### Classical music

This Monday,I get a really fantastic class which called "Music Appreciation" teached by Zhou Haihong at CCOM.

It give me a feeling that I should like classical music and I originally love.

From Mr. Zhou's class,I know that I should not try to understand the meaning which is playing.

But just feeling it and get your moving from it.

This days,I always fall into a strange mood--Don't want to learn,don't want to play,just felling like a anxiety.

"Music can wash my mind,this is true."

Life is too hard,but we can get happy from classical music.

### Bad learning skill

Just this afternoon I find that I'm very poor at learning new things.

I think sometimes I looked like what Kafka had said

Thinking twice,I know that is me,and that is true.

I always read books at midnight but play games at class,is that irony?

But along with this problem,I also can't put my all attention to what teacher is saying.

Other words, I can't get teacher's mean.

### Keep calm and carry on

This is what I heared in a adress by Bai Yansong.

It's about United Kingdom:

In world war tow,English almost been beat by Germany.

So summits of UK sent this words to people.

### Funny pictures
